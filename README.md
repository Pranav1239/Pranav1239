# Hey, I'm Pranav 👋
I'm an 18-year-old developer who focuses mainly on **frontend development**, but I don't stop there.
I build websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications—always aiming for clean, fast, and functional results.

## 🛠️ Highlights
- Built and shipped **4 production-ready mobile apps**
- Completed **20+ frontend projects** with smooth backend integration
- Managed **10+ full-stack projects**, reducing delivery time by 25%
- Worked directly with D2C brands as a **solo tech partner**
- Actively leading development as **Co-Founder & Frontend Lead at TechSolace**

## ⚡ A Little More About Me
I used to work on the **backend**, and that gives me an edge—I understand what the frontend needs, when it needs it, and how to plan better for both.
I like keeping things simple and clean. No over-complication—just fast, reliable interfaces that users actually enjoy using.
